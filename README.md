## Description

This repository is a collection of software that I am writing while learning the Swift language and Apple software development. This software is student quality. My goal is to be able to measure my progress as I learn Swift on Windows, Linux and Apple devices.

For the most part these programs are for systems level development. Database, network, memory and device integration. Everything I will need to develop home automation using controllers, macOS, iPads and iPhones. I hope to learn how to send alerts to Apple Watch as well

I am writing both command-line programs for Windows and Ubuntu and native macOS GUI programs.
